# Advent of code 2018 solutions

My attempts at solving the https://adventofcode.com/ puzzles in Rust.

All my puzzle input is included. Example inputs provided by the puzzles are used as inputs for unit tests.

**Note**: I am still learning Rust. Code might not be ideomatic or optimal in places.

## Running it

- Have Rust toolchain installed (https://rustup.rs/)
- Clone code (`git clone git@github.com:EdeMeijer/aoc2018.git`)
- In `main.rs`, uncomment the puzzle you want to run the solution for
- Run it with `cargo run --release`
